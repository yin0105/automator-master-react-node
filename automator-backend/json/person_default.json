Dostoevsky's literary works explore [[Psychological fiction|human psychology]] in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of [[Russian Empire|19th-century Russia]], and engage with a variety of philosophical and religious themes. His most acclaimed novels include ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), ''[[The Idiot]]'' (1869), [[Demons (Dostoevsky novel)|''Demons'']] (1872), and ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1880). Dostoevsky's body of works consists of 12 novels, four novellas, 16 short stories, and numerous other works. Many literary critics rate him as one of the greatest novelists in all of [[world literature]], as multiple of his works are considered highly influential masterpieces.{{sfn|Scanlan|2002}} His 1864 novella ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' is considered to be one of the first works of [[existentialism|existentialist]] literature.\n\nBorn in Moscow in 1821, Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through [[fairy tales]] and [[legend]]s, and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837 when he was 15, and around the same time, he left school to enter the [[Military Engineering-Technical University|Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute]]. After graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra money. In the mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, ''[[Poor Folk]]'', which gained him entry into [[Saint Petersburg]]'s literary circles. Arrested in 1849 for belonging to a literary group that discussed banned books critical of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]], he was sentenced to death but the sentence was [[mock execution|commuted at the last moment]]. He spent four years in a [[Siberia]]n prison camp, followed by six years of compulsory military service in exile. In the following years, Dostoevsky worked as a journalist, publishing and editing several magazines of his own and later ''[[A Writer's Diary]]'', a collection of his writings. He began to travel around western Europe and developed a [[gambling addiction]], which led to financial hardship. For a time, he had to beg for money, but he eventually became one of the most widely read and highly regarded Russian writers.\n\nDostoevsky was influenced by a wide variety of philosophers and authors including [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Sir Walter Scott|Scott]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Mikhail Lermontov|Lermontov]], [[Victor Hugo|Hugo]], [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], [[Plato]], [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Alexander Herzen|Herzen]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Vissarion Belinsky|Belinsky]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]], [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], [[George Sand|Sand]], [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], and [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]].\n\nHis writings were widely read both within and beyond his native Russia and influenced an equally great number of later writers including Russians such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Anton Chekhov]], philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and the emergence of [[Existentialism]] and [[Freudianism]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://britannica.com/biography/Fyodor-Dostoyevsky|title= Fyodor Dostoyevsky|author= Morson, Gary Saul|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|access-date= 2015-09-12|language= en}}</ref> His books have been translated into more than 170 languages, and served as the basis for many films.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}"
