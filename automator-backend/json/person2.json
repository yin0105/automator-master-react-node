A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for [[List of La Liga top scorers#All-time top scorers|most goals in La Liga]] (474), [[List of La Liga top scorers#Top scorers by season|a La Liga]] and European league season (50), [[List of La Liga hat-tricks|most hat-tricks in La Liga]] (36) and the [[List of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks|UEFA Champions League]] (8), and most [[Assist (association football)|assists]] in La Liga (192), a [[List of La Liga top scorers#Top scorers by season|La Liga]] season (21) and the [[Copa América]] (17).

Messi has scored over [[List of footballers with 500 or more goals|750 senior career goals]] for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club.\n\nBorn and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in [[2008–09 FC Barcelona season|2008–09]] he helped Barcelona achieve the first [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first [[2009 Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or]].

The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the [[Ballon d'Or]] behind [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (his perceived [[Messi–Ronaldo rivalry|career rival]]), before regaining his best form during the [[2014–15 FC Barcelona season|2014–15 campaign]], becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in [[2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or|2015]]. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record [[2019 Ballon d'Or|sixth Ballon d'Or]].\n\nAn Argentine international, Messi is both his country's [[Argentina national football team#Most capped players|highest appearance-maker]] and their [[Argentina national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]]. At youth level, he won the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]], finishing the tournament with both the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball and Golden Shoe]], and an [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold medal]] at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]]. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbler]] drew comparisons with his compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who described Messi as his [[New Maradona|successor]]. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], and reached the final of the [[2007 Copa América]], where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], for which he won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]], and the [[2015 Copa América|2015]] and [[Copa América Centenario|2016 Copa América]], winning the [[2015 Copa América#Awards|Golden Ball]] in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], a third-place finish at the [[2019 Copa América]], and won the [[2021 Copa América]], while winning the [[2021 Copa América#Awards|Golden Ball]] and [[Copa América records and statistics|Golden Boot]] award for the latter. \n\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company [[Adidas]] since 2006. According to ''[[France Football]]'', he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the [[Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes|world's highest-paid athlete]] by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2019. Messi was among [[Time 100|''Time'']]'s [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year|Laureus World Sportsman of the Year]], thus becoming the first footballer and the first team sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer (and second team-sport athlete) to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.\n{{TOClimit|4}}"
