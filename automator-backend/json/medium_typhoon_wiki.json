This region is referred to as the [[Tropical cyclone basins#Northwestern Pacific Ocean|Northwestern Pacific Basin]],<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/F1.html|author=Chris Landsea|access-date=2011-03-30|date=2010-06-01|title=Subject: F1) What regions around the globe have tropical cyclones and who is responsible for forecasting there?|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres |pages=D06108|author-link=Chris Landsea}}</ref> and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on [[Earth]], accounting for almost one-third of the world's annual tropical cyclones. For organizational purposes, the northern [[Pacific Ocean]] is divided into three regions: the eastern (North America to [[140th meridian west|140°W]]), central (140°W to 180°), and western (180° to 100°E). The [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] (RSMC) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in [[Japan]], with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in [[Hawaii]] (the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]), the [[Philippines]] and [[Hong Kong]]. While the RSMC names each system, the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year.<ref name=\"HCT\">{{cite web | title = What is the difference between a hurricane, a cyclone, and a typhoon? | work = OCEAN FACTS | publisher = [[National Ocean Service]]  | url = http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/cyclone.html | access-date = 2016-12-24 }}</ref>\n\nWithin the northwestern Pacific, there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year. Like any tropical cyclone, there are few main requirements for typhoon formation and development: (1) sufficiently warm [[sea surface temperature]]s, (2) atmospheric instability, (3) high [[relative humidity|humidity]] in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, (4) enough [[Coriolis effect]] to develop a [[low-pressure area|low pressure center]], (5) a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and (6) a low vertical [[wind shear]]. While the majority of storms form between June and November, a few storms may occur between December and May (although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time). On average, the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally. Like other basins, they are steered by the [[subtropical ridge]] towards the west or northwest, with some systems recurving near and east of [[Japan]]. The Philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls, with [[China]] and Japan being less often impacted. However, some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China. Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region, with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives. [[Taiwan]] has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest Pacific [[tropical cyclone basin]]s.\n<!--\n<ref name=\"AOML\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A1.html|title=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|access-date=2009-10-19}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cawcr.gov.au/bmrc/pubs/tcguide/globa_guide_intro.htm|title=Global Guide to Tropical Cyclone Forecasting|access-date=2009-10-19 | work = (Holland 1993). # Holland, G.J.
