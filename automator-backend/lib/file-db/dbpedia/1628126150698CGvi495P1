Irsko (anglicky Northern Ireland, irsky Tuaisceart Éireann) je jednou ze čtyř zemí Spojeného království Velké Británie a Severního Irska.

Severní Irsko je tvořeno šesti z devíti hrabství historické provincie Ulster a je tak někdy označováno. Severní Irsko vzniklo 3. května 1921 oddělením části ostrova, kde většinu obyvatel tvořili potomci britských kolonistů, kteří si přáli zůstat součástí britského království, zatímco zastánci samostatného Irska (1922) tvořili menšinu. Napětí mezi různými skupinami, které lze zjednodušeně rozdělit na probritské protestanty (loajalisté, unionisté) a na proirské katolíky (republikáni, nacionalisté), vyústilo ve vleklý severoirský konflikt. Násilnosti v zásadě ukončila Velkopáteční dohoda z roku 1998, ale křehkost tohoto smíru se opět projevila ve sporech o irskou hranici, která se po brexitu stala hranicí mezi Evropskou unií a Spojeným královstvím.","lang":"cs"},{"type":"literal","value":"Півні́чна Ірла́ндія (англ.

Oltre che come nazione, è variabilmente descritta come stato, come regione o provincia del Regno Unito a seconda dei contesti. Copre un'area di 13 843 km² nella parte nord-orientale dell'isola d'Irlanda e confina a sud con la Repubblica d'Irlanda. A partire dalla firma dell'accordo del Venerdì Santo nel 1998, l'Irlanda del Nord ha ampi margini di auto-governo all'interno del Regno Unito; secondo tale accordo, coopera con la Repubblica d'Irlanda in alcuni ambiti, mentre altri temi sono riservati al governo britannico, anche se la Repubblica d'Irlanda \"può proporre nuovi punti di vista e opinioni\" con \"sforzi determinati a risolvere i disaccordi tra i due governi\". L'Irlanda del Nord fu creata nel 1921, quando l'Irlanda fu divisa in \"Irlanda del Nord\" e \"Irlanda del Sud\" con una legge del 1920 (Government of Ireland Act) del Parlamento del Regno Unito. Diversamente dall'Irlanda del Sud, che sarebbe divenuta lo Stato Libero d'Irlanda nel 1922, la maggioranza della popolazione dell'Irlanda del Nord era unionista e lealista con il Regno Unito in quanto gran parte della popolazione era protestante e discendente di coloni provenienti dalla Gran Bretagna; tuttavia, una minoranza significativa, principalmente cattolica, era nazionalista e repubblicana, e voleva pertanto una Irlanda unita indipendente dal dominio britannico. Oggi, i primi si descrivono generalmente come britannici, mentre i secondi come irlandesi; alcune persone di entrambe le comunità si definiscono nord-irlandesi. Storicamente, l'Irlanda del Nord era segnata da discriminazione e ostilità tra le due comunità, in quella che David Trimble, vincitore del Premio Nobel per la pace, definì una \"casa fredda\" per i cattolici. Verso la fine degli anni 1960, i conflitti tra le due comunità e le forze statali coinvolte, sfociarono nei tre decenni di violenze note come Conflitto nordirlandese\" (o \"The Troubles\" in lingua inglese), che costarono la vita a oltre tremila persone e causarono oltre 50.000 feriti. L'Accordo del Venerdì Santo del 1998 fu un grande passo in avanti nel processo di pace, anche se il confessionalismo e la segregazione religiosa rimangono ancora gravi problemi sociali. L'Irlanda del Nord è stata storicamente la regione più industrializzata dell'isola. Dopo il declino seguito al periodo di turbolenza politica e sociale dei Troubles, la sua economia è cresciuta fortemente a partire dalla fine degli anni 1990. Ciò fu dovuto in parte al \"dividendo di pace\" e in parte a causa dell'aumento dei commerci con la Repubblica d'Irlanda, maggiore libertà di movimento dovuta alla fine dei controlli di sicurezza dell'Esercito Britannico e una netta diminuzione dei problemi di sicurezza. Tutto questo ha portato all'aumento del turismo, investimenti e commerci da tutto il mondo. La disoccupazione nell'Irlanda del Nord ha toccato il suo massimo nel 1986, con il 17,2%, per poi scendere fino al 6,1% nell'agosto 2014 e per poi decrescere ulteriormente dell'1,2% nel corso dell'anno, in maniera simile al 6,2% del complesso del Regno Unito. Il 58,2% dei disoccupati non ha occupazione da oltre un anno. Le principali personalità artistiche e sportive dell'Irlanda del Nord includono Van Morrison, Rory McIlroy, Joey Dunlop e George Best. Alcuni che provengono dall'Irlanda del Nord hanno successivamente chiesto ed ottenuto la cittadinanza irlandese, come ad esempio il poeta Séamus Heaney; al tempo stesso anche cittadini irlandesi che vogliano stabilirsi in Irlanda del Nord o in Gran Bretagna possono ottenere la cittadinanza britannica con modalità più semplici rispetto ad altri immigrati. I legami culturali tra Irlanda del Nord, il resto dell'Irlanda e la parte restante del Regno Unito sono complessi, in quanto l'Irlanda del Nord gode di un mix culturale che proviene dall'Irlanda e dal Regno Unito. In molti sport, l'isola dell'Irlanda compete con un'unica squadra, con l'eccezione del calcio e del netball, le cui organizzazioni sono separate da quelle della Repubblica d'Irlanda. L'Irlanda del Nord compete singolarmente ai Giochi del Commonwealth, e gli atleti della nazione possono competere sia con la Gran Bretagna, sia con l'Irlanda ai Giochi olimpici. In quanto territorio appartenente al Regno Unito, ha avuto come motto Quis separabit? (in latino significa Chi potrà separarci?).

Nordirland gränsar till Republiken Irland i söder och väster. 2011 var dess befolkning 1 810 863 invånare, vilket utgör cirka 30 % av öns totala befolkning och cirka 3 % av befolkningen i Storbritannien. Sedan undertecknandet av långfredagsavtalet 1998 är Nordirland i stort sett självstyrande. Enligt avtalet samarbetar Nordirland med resten av Irland – från vilken det delades 1921 – på vissa politikområden, medan andra områden är reserverade för Storbritanniens regering, även om Irland \"kan framföra synpunkter och förslag\". Nordirland var under många år platsen för en våldsam och bitter konflikt mellan folkgrupper – The Troubles – som orsakades av splittring mellan nationalister, som ser sig som irländare och är övervägande romersk-katolska, och unionister, som ser sig som britter och är övervägande protestantiska. Dessutom beskriver sig människor från båda sidor av samhället sig själva som nordirländare. Unionisterna vill att Nordirland kvarstår som en del av Storbritannien, medan nationalisterna vill ha en återförening med resten av Irland, oberoende av brittiskt styre. Sedan 1998 har de flesta av de paramilitära grupperna inblandade i oroligheterna upphört med sina väpnade kampanjer. Nordirland har traditionellt varit den mest industrialiserade regionen av ön. Efter att ha minskat som en följd av politisk och social oro i den andra halvan av 1900-talet har industrialiseringen vuxit kraftigt sedan 1990-talet. Detta beror dels på en \"fredsutdelning\", dels på bandet och den ökade handeln med Republiken Irland. Framstående konstnärer och idrottare från Nordirland inkluderar Van Morrison, Rory McIlroy och George Best.

Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's population and about 3% of the UK's population. The Northern Ireland Assembly (colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location), established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998, holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas. Northern Ireland was created in 1921, when Ireland was partitioned by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, creating a devolved government for the six northeastern counties. The majority of Northern Ireland's population were unionists, who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom. They were generally the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain. Meanwhile, the majority in Southern Ireland (which became the Irish Free State in 1922), and a significant minority in Northern Ireland, were Irish nationalists and Catholics who wanted a united independent Ireland. Today, the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish, while a Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed by a large minority from all backgrounds. The creation of Northern Ireland was accompanied by violence both in defence of and against partition. During 1920–22, the capital Belfast saw major communal violence, mainly between Protestant unionist and Catholic nationalist civilians. More than 500 were killed and more than 10,000 became refugees, mostly Catholics. In the following decades, Northern Ireland had an unbroken series of Unionist Party governments. There was informal mutual segregation by both communities, and the Unionist governments were accused of discrimination against the Irish nationalist and Catholic minority, in what First Minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, called a \"cold house\" for Catholics. In the late 1960s, a campaign to end discrimination against Catholics and nationalists was opposed by loyalists, who saw it as a republican front. This unrest sparked the Troubles; a thirty-year conflict involving republican and loyalist paramilitaries and state forces, which claimed over 3,500 lives and injured 50,000 others. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement was a major step in the peace process, including paramilitary disarmament and security normalisation, although sectarianism and segregation remain major social problems, and sporadic violence has continued. The economy of Northern Ireland was the most industrialised in Ireland at the time of partition, but declined as a result of the political and social turmoil of the Troubles. Its economy has grown significantly since the late 1990s. The initial growth came from the \"peace dividend\" and increased trade with the Republic of Ireland, continuing with a significant increase in tourism, investment and business from around the world. Unemployment in Northern Ireland peaked at 17.2% in 1986, dropping to 6.1% for June–August 2014 and down by 1.2 percentage points over the year, similar to the UK figure of 6.2%. Cultural links between Northern Ireland, the rest of Ireland, and the rest of the UK are complex, with Northern Ireland sharing both the culture of Ireland and the culture of the United Kingdom. In many sports, the island of Ireland fields a single team, with the Northern Ireland national football team being an exception to this.

Secara umum, kaum unionis memandang diri sebagai orang Britania, sedangkan kaum nasionalis memandang diri sebagai orang Irlandia, meskipun kedua-dua identitas ini tidak selalu saling eksklusif. Selain itu, banyak orang dari kedua belah komunitas memandang mereka sebagai Orang Irlandia Utara.","lang":"in"},{"type":"literal","value":"Noord-Ierland (Engels: Northern Ireland, Iers-Gaelisch: Tuaisceart Éireann, Ulster Schots: Norlin Airlann) maakt als constituerend land met Engeland, Schotland en Wales deel uit van één staat: het Verenigd Koninkrijk. Het is van deze vier gebieden het enige dat niet op het eiland Groot-Brittannië, maar op het eiland Ierland ligt en daarvan het noordoostelijk deel uitmaakt. Noord-Ierland grenst aan de Republiek Ierland. In Noord-Ierland is, net als in geheel Ierland, Engels de dominante taal. Op kleinere schaal, en vooral om symbolische redenen, wordt ook soms Iers gebruikt, zij het minder dan in de Republiek Ierland. Met 13.793 km2 bedraagt de oppervlakte van Noord-Ierland ongeveer de helft van België of een derde van Nederland. Bij de volkstelling van 2019 telde Noord-Ierland 1.893.700 inwoners. Het land heeft daarmee een bevolkingsdichtheid van 137 inwoners per km². Noord-Ierland wordt omschreven als een land, provincie of regio van het Verenigd Koninkrijk. Sinds de ondertekening van het Goedevrijdagakkoord van 1998 is Noord-Ierland hoofdzakelijk zelfbesturend, maar in de internationale betrekkingen speelt als soevereine staat alleen het Verenigd Koninkrijk een rol. Het Goedevrijdagakkoord stipuleert dat indien een meerderheid van de bevolking dat wil, Noord-Ierland deel kan worden van Ierland. De unionisten, historisch protestanten die 48% van de bevolking uitmaken, willen in meerderheid de band met de Britse unie behouden. De katholieken zijn historisch eerder Iersgezind en maken voorlopig 45% van de bevolking uit. In de Assemblee voor Noord-Ierland, het parlement van Noord-Ierland zijn de stemmen voor unionisten (circa 45% in 2017) en republikeinen/nationalisten (circa 40% in 2017) in dalende lijnen, ten voordele van andere politieke partijen die een meer gematigd standpunt innemen (circa 13% in 2017). In 2017 hadden voor het eerst unionisten geen meerderheid in zetels meer in de Assemblee. Er wordt, net als in de rest van het Verenigd Koninkrijk, betaald met het pond sterling, dat is onderverdeeld in 100 pence. Het Noord-Ierse autokenteken is GB (traditioneel kenteken van het VK). De tijd is gelijk aan de Greenwichtijd, het telefoonprefix is 44 (maar vanuit Ierland gebruikt men een binnenlands nummer) en het topleveldomein is .uk.","lang":"nl"},{"type":"literal","value":"Northern Ireland (Irish: Tuaisceart Éireann [ˈt̪ˠu͜əʃkʲəɾˠt̪ˠ ˈeːɾʲən̪ˠ] (); Ulster-Scots: Norlin Airlann) is a part of the United Kingdom that is  as a country, province, territory or region. Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland.

Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas. Northern Ireland was created in 1921, when Ireland was partitioned by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The majority of Northern Ireland's population were unionists, who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom. They were generally the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain. Meanwhile, the majority in Southern Ireland (which became the Irish Free State in 1922), and a significant minority in Northern Ireland, were Irish nationalists and Catholics who wanted a united independent Ireland. Today, the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish, while a Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed by a large minority from all backgrounds. The creation of Northern Ireland was accompanied by violence both in defence of and against partition. During 1920–22, the capital Belfast saw major communal violence, mainly between Protestant unionist and Catholic nationalist civilians. More than 500 were killed and more than 10,000 became refugees, mostly Catholics. In the following decades, Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, called a \"cold house\" for Catholics. In the late 1960s, a campaign to end discrimination against Catholics and nationalists was opposed by loyalists, who saw it as a republican front. This unrest sparked the Troubles; a thirty-year conflict involving republican and loyalist paramilitaries and state forces, which claimed over 3,500 lives and injured 50,000 others. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement was a major step in the peace process, including paramilitary disarmament and security normalisation, although sectarianism and segregation remain major social problems, and sporadic violence has continued. The economy of Northern Ireland was the most industrialised in Ireland at the time of partition, but declined as a result of the political and social turmoil of the Troubles.

Meanwhile, the majority in Southern Ireland (which became the Irish Free State in 1922), and a significant minority in Northern Ireland, were Irish nationalists and Catholics who wanted a united independent Ireland. Today, the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish, while a Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed by a large minority from all backgrounds. The creation of Northern Ireland was accompanied by violence both in defence of and against partition. During 1920–22, the capital Belfast saw major communal violence, mainly between Protestant unionist and Catholic nationalist civilians. More than 500 were killed and more than 10,000 became refugees, mostly Catholics. In the following decades, Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, called a \"cold house\" for Catholics. In the late 1960s, a campaign to end discrimination against Catholics and nationalists was opposed by loyalists, who saw it as a republican front. This unrest sparked the Troubles; a thirty-year conflict involving republican and loyalist paramilitaries and state forces, which claimed over 3,500 lives and injured 50,000 others. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement was a major step in the peace process, including paramilitary disarmament and security normalisation, although sectarianism and segregation remain major social problems, and sporadic violence has continued. The economy of Northern Ireland was the most industrialised in Ireland at the time of partition, but declined as a result of the political and social turmoil of the Troubles. Its economy has grown significantly since the late 1990s. The initial growth came from the \"peace dividend\" and increased trade with the Republic of Ireland, continuing with a significant increase in tourism, investment and business from around the world.

Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland.

Northern Ireland was created in 1921, when Ireland was partitioned by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, creating a devolved government for the six northeastern counties. The majority of Northern Ireland's population were unionists, who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom. They were generally the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain.

The creation of Northern Ireland was accompanied by violence both in defence of and against partition. During 1920–22, the capital Belfast saw major communal violence, mainly between Protestant unionist and Catholic nationalist civilians. More than 500 were killed and more than 10,000 became refugees, mostly Catholics. In the following decades, Northern Ireland had an unbroken series of Unionist Party governments. There was informal mutual segregation by both communities, and the Unionist governments were accused of discrimination against the Irish nationalist and Catholic minority, in what First Minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, called a \"cold house\" for Catholics. In the late 1960s, a campaign to end discrimination against Catholics and nationalists was opposed by loyalists, who saw it as a republican front.

Northern Ireland was created in 1921, when Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Unlike Southern Ireland, which would become the Irish Free State in 1922, the majority of Northern Ireland's population were unionists, who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom. Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain. However, a significant minority, mostly Catholics, were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule.

In the late 1960s, conflict between state forces and chiefly Protestant unionists on the one hand, and chiefly Catholic nationalists on the other, erupted into three decades of violence known as the Troubles, which claimed over 3,500 lives and injured over 50,000 others.

Northern Ireland was the most industrialised region of Ireland, declining as a result of the political and social turmoil of the Troubles, but economically growing significantly since the late 1990s. The initial growth came from the \"peace dividend\" and the links which increased trade with the Republic of Ireland, continuing with a significant increase in tourism, investment and business from around the world. Unemployment in Northern Ireland peaked at 17.2% in 1986, dropping to 6.1% for June–August 2014 and down by 1.2 percentage points over the year, similar to the UK figure of 6.2%.
