Um dos maiores impérios da história da humanidade, que se estendia por três continentes, o Império Russo foi superado em massa de terra apenas pelos impérios Britânico e Mongol. A ascensão do Império Russo aconteceu em associação ao declínio de potências vizinhas rivais: o Império Sueco, a Comunidade Polaco-Lituana, a Pérsia e o Império Otomano. Ele desempenhou um papel importante entre 1812 e 1814 ao derrotar as ambições de Napoleão de controlar a Europa e se expandiu para o oeste e sul. A Dinastia Romanov governou o Império Russo desde 1721 até 1762, e sua Alemão-descendentes ramo cadete, a Casa de Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov, governou a partir de 1762. No início do século XIX, o Império Russo se estendia do Oceano Ártico, no norte, até o Mar Negro, no sul, e do Mar Báltico, a oeste, até o Oceano Pacífico. Até 1867 o império também compreendia o Alasca na América do Norte (América Russa). Com 125,6 milhões de indivíduos registrados pelo censo de 1897, tinha a terceira maior população do mundo na época, depois da China Qing e da Índia. Como todos os impérios, incluiu uma grandes disparidades econômicas, étnicas e religiosas. Houve numerosos elementos dissidentes, que lançaram numerosas rebeliões e tentativas de assassinato; eles eram observados de perto pela polícia secreta, sendo que milhares foram exilados para a Sibéria. Economicamente, o império tinha uma base agrícola predominantemente, com baixa produtividade em grandes propriedades trabalhadas por servos (até que eles foram libertos em 1861). A economia lentamente industrializou-se com a ajuda de investimentos estrangeiros em ferrovias e fábricas. A terra era governada por uma nobreza (os boiardos) entre os séculos X e XVII e, posteriormente, por um imperador. O czar Ivan III (1462-1505) lançou as bases para o império que surgiu depois. Ele triplicou o território de seu Estado, acabou com o domínio da Horda de Ouro, renovou o Kremlin de Moscou e lançou as bases do Estado russo. O czar Pedro, o Grande (1682-1725) lutou inúmeras guerras e expandiu um já enorme império em uma grande potência europeia. Ele mudou a capital de Moscou para a nova cidade de São Petersburgo e liderou uma revolução cultural que substituiu alguns dos costumes sociais e políticos medievais e tradicionalistas por sistema moderno científico e racionalista. Catarina, a Grande (reinou 1762-1796) governou durante uma era de ouro. Ela expandiu o Estado russo através da conquista, colonização e diplomacia, continuando a política de modernização iniciada por Pedro, o Grande. O czar Alexandre II (1855-1881) promoveu inúmeras reformas, principalmente a emancipação de todos os 23 milhões de servos em 1861. Sua política na Europa Oriental envolvia proteger os cristãos ortodoxos sob o domínio do Império Otomano. Essa conexão em 1914 levou à entrada da Rússia na Primeira Guerra Mundial ao lado de França, Reino Unido e Sérvia, contra os impérios Alemão, Austríaco e Otomano. O Império Russo funcionava como uma monarquia absoluta até a Revolução de 1905 e, em seguida, tornou-se uma monarquia constitucional. O império ruiu durante a Revolução de Fevereiro de 1917, em grande parte como resultado de falhas enormes na sua participação na Primeira Guerra Mundial.","lang":"pt"},{"type":"literal","value":"러시아 제국(러시아어: Росси́йская импе́рия [rɐˈsʲiɪ̯skəɪ̯ə ɪm⁽ʲ⁾ˈpʲerʲɪɪ̯ə], 문자 개혁 이전: Россі́йская импе́рія) 혹은 제정 러시아는 러시아의 표트르 1세가 1721년에 군주 칭호를 차르에서 임페라토르로 개칭하며 형성된 제국이다. 제1차 세계 대전 도중인 1917년 2월에 일어난 러시아 혁명에 의해서 붕괴될 때까지 존재했다. 러시아 제국은 대영제국과 몽골 제국에 이어 세계에서 3번째로 거대한 제국이었으며, 유럽, 아시아, 북아메리카 대륙에 걸쳐있었다. 러시아 제국은 스웨덴 제국과 폴란드-리투아니아 연방, 오스만 제국의 쇠퇴와 함께 본격적으로 발전하기 시작하였다. 1812년과 1814년에는 나폴레옹의 침략을 막아내며 유럽의 주요 세력으로 떠올랐다. 로마노프 황실이 러시아 제국을 1721년에서 1762년까지 통치하였다. 1762년 이후에는 로마노프가의 부계 친척 가문인 홀슈타인고트로프로마노프 가문이 제국의 황계를 이어 1917년에 멸망할 때까지 황제의 자리를 차지하였다. 19세기 초, 러시아 제국은 북극해에서 발트 해까지 영토를 확장하였고 북부 캘리포니아까지 손길을 뻗쳤다. 당시 러시아 제국은 1억 2560만 명의 인구로 세계에서 3번째로 많은 인구수를 자랑했으며, 청나라와 인도와 같이 매우 다양한 민족들로 이루어져 있었다. 이같이 다양한 민족구성은 제국 내에서 수많은 반란과 분열을 초래했으며, 이 때문에 제국은 비밀경찰들을 활용하여 사회의 불순분자들을 시베리아의 형무소로 보내 억압하였다. 러시아 제국은 경제적으로는 후진적인 농업 중심 국가였다. 거의 대부분의 토지들은 낮은 생산성의 농노들이 경작했으며, 봉건적인 계약으로 묶여 있었다. 농노들은 1861년에 해방되었으나, 여전히 도시와 시골 지방에서는 귀족 계급들이 주도권을 쥐고 놓아주지 않았다. 경제는 외국 자본들의 투자를 받아 점진적으로 근대화되기 시작하였다. 다만 제국은 10세기부터 17세기까지 귀족들, 그리고 최종적으로는 차르에 의해 통치를 받았다. 이반 3세는 당시 러시아의 영토를 3배로 늘리며 제국의 기초를 놓았다. 표트르 1세는 수많은 전쟁에서 승리하며 러시아 제국을 유럽의 주요 강국으로 만들었으며, 서구적인 디자인의 상트페테르부르크로 천도하여 국가의 발전을 꾀했다. 그는 전통주의자들에 맞서 러시아를 근대화, 서구화시키기 위해 노력했고, 과학과 근대화의 물결에 편승하여 국력을 신장시키기 위해 최선을 다했다. 예카테리나 2세는 러시아 제국의 황금기를 이끌었으며, 표트르 1세의 현대화 정책을 추구해나가는 동시에 정복과 식민지화, 외교를 통해 제국의 영토를 끊임없이 늘려나갔다. 알렉산드르 2세는 수많은 개혁정책들을 폈다. 가장 대표적인 예가 1861년에 2,300만 명에 달하는 농노들을 해방시킨 사건이었다. 그는 동유럽에서 정교회의 수호자를 자처하며 오스만 제국에서 정교회 신도들을 보호하였으며, 이때의 관계로 인하여 1914년에 제 1차 세계대전에서 독일, 오스트리아-헝가리, 오스만 제국을 상대로 프랑스와 영국의 편에서 전쟁을 벌이게 된다. 러시아 제국은 1905년 혁명으로 인해 입헌군주정이 설립되기 이전까지 정교회, 귀족정, 국가주의가 합쳐진 전제군주정이었다. 입헌 군주정 정부는 1차 세계대전 동안 제대로 된 국정을 수행하지 못했고, 결국 국민들의 분노는 극에 달해 결국 1917년 2월 혁명으로 인하여 제국은 완벽히 무너지게 된다. 황족은 1918년에 볼셰비키들에 의해 모두 처형당했고, 거의 대부분의 귀족계급들은 처형당하거나 망명길에 올라야만 했다. 제국 멸망 이후 케렌스키 주도의 임시 정부는 1917년 10월 혁명 이전까지 존속했고, 이후로는 1991년까지 소비에트 연방이 러시아 땅을 통치했다. 러시아 제국은 구 소련의 영토를 비롯해 핀란드, 폴란드의 영토를 차지하였고, 19세기 중반까지 알래스카를 통치한 바 있으며, 제국주의 시기에는 만주, 신장, 랴오둥 반도를 비롯한 동아시아 지역과 이란 및 오스만 제국의 통치 지역에 영향력을 행사했다.","lang":"ko"},{"type":"literal","value":"L'Impero russo (in russo: Российская империя?, traslitterato: Rossijskaja imperija), spesso indicato anche come Russia imperiale, fu l'organismo statale che per volontà di Pietro I il Grande (1682–1725) governò la Russia zarista dal 1721 fino alla forzata abdicazione di Nicola II (1894–1917) a seguito della rivoluzione di febbraio del 1917. Venne preceduto dal regno degli zar moscoviti e seguito dall'Unione Sovietica. Tutti gli zar dell'impero appartennero alla famiglia dei Romanov. Dal punto di vista territoriale fu il terzo Stato più esteso della storia: nel 1790 si estendeva su tre continenti (Europa, Asia e Nord America), confinando tanto con la Prussia quanto con la provincia del Canada (Impero britannico), affacciandosi sia sul mar Baltico che sull'oceano Pacifico. La superficie era di 23,7 milioni di km² (22,8 nel 1866), circa 1⁄6 di tutte le terre emerse del pianeta. Economicamente l'impero era pesantemente legato all'agricoltura, con una bassa produttività ed una forte presenza di servitù della gleba sino a quando questa non venne abolita definitivamente nel 1861. L'economia col tempo seppe industrializzarsi con l'aiuto di investimenti stranieri nelle ferrovie e nelle fabbriche. La terra venne perlopiù governata dalla nobiltà locale (boiardi) dal X al XVII secolo e formalmente era governata dall'imperatore (zar). Lo zar Ivan III (1462–1505) preparò il terreno per accogliere le riforme dei secoli successivi: egli triplicò il territorio del suo Stato, pose fine alla dominazione dell'Orda d'oro, rinnovò il Cremlino di Mosca e fondò le principali istituzioni dello stato russo. Lo zar Pietro il Grande (1682–1725) combatté numerose guerre e costruì un impero moderno e forte al punto da imporsi come una tra le maggiori potenze europee della sua epoca. Egli spostò la capitale da Mosca alla sua nuova città di San Pietroburgo e rimpiazzò i tradizionali e medievali modelli sociali e politici con un sistema razionalista ispirato al modello occidentale. Caterina la Grande (1761–1796) regnò durante l'epoca d'oro della Russia: ella si preoccupò di espandere rapidamente la nazione con la conquista, la colonizzazione e la diplomazia. Continuò l'opera di modernizzazione introdotta da Pietro il Grande seguendo linee europeiste. Lo zar Alessandro II (1855–1881) promosse numerose riforme tra cui quella relativa all'emancipazione di 23 milioni di servi nel 1861. La sua politica nell'Europa orientale fu quella di proteggere i locali cristiani ortodossi che si trovavano a vivere sotto il governo dell'Impero ottomano. Questo coinvolgimento ed altri portarono la Russia a entrare nella prima guerra mondiale nel 1914 e a schierarsi con Francia, Regno Unito e Serbia contro Germania, Austria-Ungheria e Impero ottomano. La Russia rimase una monarchia assoluta sino alla rivoluzione del 1905 e quindi divenne una monarchia costituzionale.

Будучи крупнейшим евразийским государством, располагалась в Восточной Европе, Северной Европе, Северной Азии, Средней Азии и Северной Америке (до 1867 года). Империя была провозглашена 22 октября (2 ноября) 1721 года по итогам Северной войны, когда по прошению сенаторов Государь, Царь и Великий Князь всея Руси Пётр I принял титулы Императора Всероссийского и Отца Отечества. Столицей Российской империи с 1721 по 1728 и с 1730 по 1917 годы был Санкт-Петербург (в 1914—1917 годах Петроград), а в 1728—1730 годах — Москва. Российская империя была третьим по площади из когда-либо существовавших государств (после Британской и Монгольской империй). К концу своего существования она простиралась до Северного Ледовитого океана на севере и Чёрного моря на юге, до Балтийского моря на западе и Тихого океана на востоке. Во главе империи — император Всероссийский, обладал абсолютной властью до 1905 года (Манифеста 1905 года) за исключением краткого периода в начале правления императрицы Всероссийской Анны Иоанновны, когда действовали навязанные ей членами Верховного тайного совета при вступлении на престол кондиции, ограничивающие ее абсолютизм. Государственным строем Российской Империи являлась абсолютная монархия на основе идеологической доктрины «Православие, Самодержавие, Народ» до революции 1905 года, в результате которой была установлена дуалистическая монархия. После Февральской революции 1917 года царь Николай II отрекся от престола. Сразу после этого было создано Временное Правительство, которое 1 (14) сентября 1917 года провозгласило страну республикой (хотя этот вопрос относился к компетенции Учредительного собрания, которое 5 (18) января 1918 года также объявило Россию республикой). В результате Октябрьской революции большевики захватили власть, что привело к гражданской войне. В 1918 году коммунисты казнили императорскую семью, а в 1922 году основали Советский Союз. Династия Романовых правила Российской Империей с 1721 по 1762 год. Её матрилинейная ветвь немецкого происхождения по отцовской линии (Гольштейн-Готторп-Романовы), правила с 1762 года до свержения монархии. В первой и единственной переписи населения Империи 1897 года были зарегистрировано 125,6 миллиона человек, что в то время было третьим по величине показателем в мире после Империи Цин и Британской Индии. Оно быстро росло, и к 1916 году её оценивалось в 181 миллион человек. В различные эпохи экономика империи имела различные формы и размеры. До 1861 около 37% крестьян были крепостным и не имели личной свободы. После отмены крепостного права экономика начала быстрый рост, и к 1913 Российская Империя занимала 3-е место в мире по ВВП, после Британской Империи и США. Процесс модернизации экономики проходил в том числе с помощью иностранных инвестиций в инфраструктуру и промышленность.

Η εποχή αυτή αναφέρεται επιγραμματικά και ως αυτοκρατορική. Με μέγιστη έκταση περίπου 28.400.000 τ.χλμ. στα μέσα του 19ου αιώνα, είναι το τρίτο μεγαλύτερο κράτος στην ιστορία της ανθρωπότητας μετά τη Μεγάλη Βρετανία των αρχών του 20ού αιώνα (η οποία όμως διέθετε αποικίες) και τη μεσαιωνική Μογγολική Αυτοκρατορία του Κουμπλάι Χαν. Η Ρωσική Αυτοκρατορία ή απλά Ρωσία ήταν μια αυτοκρατορία που εκτεινόταν στην Ευρασία και τη Βόρεια Αμερική από το 1721, μετά το τέλος του Μεγάλου Βόρειου Πόλεμου, έως ότου η Δημοκρατία ανακήρυξε την Προσωρινή Κυβέρνηση που πήρε την εξουσία μετά την Επανάσταση του Φεβρουαρίου του 1917. Ο επικεφαλής της Ρωσικής Αυτοκρατορίας έφερε τον τίτλο του Αυτοκράτορα, σε αντίθεση με τους προκατόχους του που αποκαλούνταν Τσάροι (Καίσαρες) του Βασιλείου της Ρωσίας. Πάντως στις περισσότερες γλώσσες του κόσμου, μεταξύ των οποίων και στην ελληνική, ο όρος τσάρος συνέχισε να χρησιμοποιείται. Όλοι οι αυτοκράτορες της συγκεκριμένης περιόδου προέρχονταν από τον Οίκο των Ρομάνοφ. Η αυτοκρατορική εποχή μπορεί να χωρισθεί σε δύο μεγάλες περιόδους. Η πρώτη (18ος αι.) ξεκινά με το Μέγα Πέτρο και κλείνει με τη Μεγάλη Αικατερίνη - είναι η εποχή που η Ρωσία αποκτά τις δύο πολυπόθητες θαλάσσιες εξόδους στη Βαλτική και στη Μαύρη Θάλασσα αντίστοιχα, αλλά έχει και μία μεγάλη περίοδο εσωστρέφειας στο κέντρο της. Η δεύτερη (19ος αι.) είναι η περίοδος της πολιτικής σταθερότητας, της εκβιομηχάνισης και της ανάδειξης σε παγκόσμια υπερδύναμη, αλλά συνάμα και της επιμονής σε παρωχημένες κοινωνικοπολιτικές δομές. Αυτή η επιμονή θα δημιουργήσει τις συνθήκες για δύο επαναστάσεις στις αρχές του 20ού αιώνα (1905, 1917) και τη δημιουργία του πρώτου κομμουνιστικού κράτους στον κόσμο. Η άνοδος της Ρωσικής Αυτοκρατορίας συνέβη σε συνδυασμό με την παρακμή των γειτονικών αντίπαλων δυνάμεων: της Σουηδικής Αυτοκρατορίας, της Πολωνικής-Λιθουανικής Κοινοπολιτείας, της Περσίας και της Οθωμανικής Αυτοκρατορίας. Διαδραμάτισε σημαντικό ρόλο το 1812-1814 στη ματαίωση των φιλοδοξιών του Ναπολέοντα να ελέγξει την Ευρώπη και να επεκταθεί στα δυτικά και στα νότια. Ο Οίκος των Ρομανώφ κυβέρνησε τη Ρωσική Αυτοκρατορία από το 1721 μέχρι το 1762 και ο εκ Γερμανίας συγκαταγόμενος κλάδος του, ο Χόλσταϊν-Γκότορπ-Ρομανώφ, από το 1762. Στις αρχές του 19ου αιώνα η Ρωσική Αυτοκρατορία εκτεινόταν από τον Αρκτικό Ωκεανό στο βορρά μέχρι τη Μαύρη Θάλασσα στο νότο και από τη Βαλτική Θάλασσα στα δυτικά μέχρι τον Ειρηνικό Ωκεανό και μέχρι το 1867 μέχρι την Αλάσκα στην Αμερική στα ανατολικά. Με 125,6 εκατομμύρια υπηκόους, που καταγράφηκαν με την απογραφή του 1897, είχε τον τρίτο μεγαλύτερο πληθυσμό στον κόσμο την εποχή εκείνη, μετά την Κίνα και την Ινδία. Όπως όλες οι αυτοκρατορίες, παρουσίαζε μεγάλη ανομοιογένεια οικονομική, εθνοτική και θρησκευτική. Υπήρχαν πολλά διαφωνούντα στοιχεία, που πραγματοποίησαν πολλές εξεγέρσεις και απόπειρες δολοφονίας και παρακολουθούντο στενά από τη μυστική αστυνομία, με χιλιάδες τους εξόριστους στη Σιβηρία. Από οικονομική άποψη η αυτοκρατορία είχε κατά κύριο λόγο γεωργική βάση, με χαμηλή παραγωγικότητα σε μεγάλα κτήματα που δούλευαν οι δουλοπάροικοι (έως ότου ελευθερώθηκαν το 1861). Η οικονομία εκβιομηχανίστηκε αργά με τη βοήθεια ξένων επενδύσεων σε σιδηροδρόμους και εργοστάσια. Η γη ελεγχόταν από την αριστοκρατία (τούς βογιάρους) από το 10ο ως το 17ο αιώνα και στη συνέχεια από τον αυτοκράτορα. Ο Τσάρος Ιβάν Γ΄ (1462-1505) έθεσε τα θεμέλια της αυτοκρατορίας, που αναδύθηκε αργότερα. Τριπλασίασε το έδαφος του κράτους του, τερμάτισε την κυριαρχία της Χρυσής Ορδής, ανακαίνισε το Κρεμλίνο της Μόσχας και έθεσε τα θεμέλια του ρωσικού κράτους. Ο Αυτοκράτορας Πέτρος ο Μέγας (1682-1725) διεξήγαγε πολλούς πολέμους και επέκτεινε μια ήδη τεράστια αυτοκρατορία σε μεγάλη ευρωπαϊκή δύναμη. Μετέφερε την πρωτεύουσα από τη Μόσχα στη νέα πόλη-πρότυπο της Αγίας Πετρούπολης και ηγήθηκε μιας πολιτιστικής επανάστασης, που αντικατέστησε μερικά από τα παραδοσιακά και μεσαιωνικά κοινωνικά και πολιτικά ήθη με ένα σύγχρονο, επιστημονικό, προσανατολισμένο προς την Ευρώπη, ορθολογικό σύστημα. Η Αυτοκράτειρα Αικατερίνη η Μεγάλη (βασίλεψε το 1762-1796) ηγήθηκε σε μια χρυσή εποχή. Επέκτεινε το κράτος με κατακτήσεις, αποικισμό και διπλωματία, συνεχίζοντας τον πολιτικό εκσυγχρονισμό του Μεγάλου Πέτρου κατά τα Δυτικοευρωπαϊκά πρότυπα. Ο Αυτοκράτορας Αλέξανδρος Β΄ (1855-1881) προώθησε πολυάριθμες μεταρρυθμίσεις, με θεαματικότερη τη απελευθέρωση και των 23 εκατομμυρίων δουλοπάροικων το 1861. Η πολιτική του στην Ανατολική Ευρώπη περιλάμβανε την προστασία των Ορθοδόξων Χριστιανών υπό την κυριαρχία της Οθωμανικής Αυτοκρατορίας. Η εμπλοκή αυτή το 1914 οδήγησε στην είσοδο της Ρωσίας στον Α΄ Παγκόσμιο Πόλεμο στο πλευρό της Γαλλίας, του Ηνωμένου Βασιλείου και της Σερβίας, κατά της Γερμανικής, της Αυστριακής και της Οθωμανικής Αυτοκρατορίας. Η Ρωσική Αυτοκρατορία λειτουργούσε ως απόλυτη μοναρχία μέχρι την Επανάσταση του 1905 και στη συνέχεια έγινε de jure συνταγματική μοναρχία. Η αυτοκρατορία κατέρρευσε κατά την Επανάσταση του Φεβρουαρίου 1917, σε μεγάλο βαθμό ως αποτέλεσμα των μαζικών αποτυχιών στη συμμετοχή της στον Α΄ Παγκόσμιο Πόλεμο.","lang":"el"},{"type":"literal","value":"Kekaisaran Rusia (bahasa Rusia: Россійская Имперія (lama), Российская Империя (modern); Rossiyskaya Imperiya) adalah kekaisaran yang pernah ada sejak tahun 1721-1917.

Jednalo se o třetí územně nejrozsáhlejší říši v dějinách lidstva, která se ve svém největším rozsahu rozkládala na třech kontinentech - Evropě, Asii a Severní Americe a co do velikosti byla překonána pouze britskou a mongolskou říší. Vzestup Ruské říše se časově shodoval s úpadkem sousedních konkurenčních mocností: Švédské říše, Polsko-litevské unie, Persie a Osmanské říše. V letech 1812–1814 sehrála zásadní roli v porážce Napoleonových ambicí ovládnou Evropu a rozšířila své území se na západ a na jih. Dynastie Romanovců vládla Ruské říši od roku 1721 do roku 1762. Od roku 1762 do konce říše vládla jeho matrilineální větev patrilinearity německého původu - dynastie Holstein‑Gottorp‑Romanov. Na začátku 19. století Ruská říše zaujímala území od Severního ledového oceánu na severu k Černému moři na jihu, od Baltského moře na západě k Aljašce a severní Kalifornii v Americe na východě. Se 125,6 miliony obyvatel zjištěných sčítáním lidu v roce 1897 měla v té době po říši Čching a Indii třetí největší populaci na světě. Stejně jako všechny říše i ruská měla velkou rozmanitost pokud jde o ekonomiku, národnosti, jazyky a náboženství. V průběhu staletí zde bylo mnoho disidentských prvků, které rozněcovaly četné vzpoury a atentáty. Od 19. století byly přísně sledovány carskou tajnou policií a tisíce odpůrců carismu byly vyhnány na Sibiř. Ekonomicky byla říše převážně zemědělského charakteru s nízkou produktivitou na velkých polnostech obhospodařovaných ruskými rolníky, známých jako nevolníci, kteří byli s půdou svázáni feudálním uspořádáním. Nevolníci byli osvobozeni v roce 1861, ale šlechta držící půdu si kontrolu zachovala. Ekonomika se pomalu industrializovala pomocí zahraničních investic do železnic a továren. Od 10. do 17. století vládla zemi šlechtická třída - bojaři a následně car. Základy pro budoucí říši položil již car Ivan III. (1462–1505). Zdvojnásobil území svého státu, ukončil dominanci Zlaté hordy, zrekonstruoval moskevský Kreml a položil základy ruského státu. Car Petr Veliký (1682–1725) bojoval v mnoha konfliktech a rozšířil již tak obrovskou říši na významnou evropskou mocnost. Přesunul hlavní město z Moskvy do nového města Petrohradu, které mělo značný evropský ráz. Vedl kulturní obrodu, která nahradila některé tradiční a středověké sociální a politické morésy moderním, vědeckým, evropským a racionálním systémem. Za císařovny Kateřiny Veliké (vládla 1762–1796) říše zažila zlatý věk; rozšířila území dobýváním, kolonizací a diplomacií a pokračovala v politice modernizace Petra Velikého dle západoevropských směrů. Car Alexandr II. (1855–1881) podporoval četné reformy, nejdramatičtěji v roce 1861 zrovnoprávněním všech 23 milionů nevolníků. Jeho politika ve východní Evropě zahrnovala ochranu pravoslavných křesťanů pod nadvládou Osmanské říše. Toto spojení vedlo v roce 1914 k vstupu Ruska do první světové války na straně Dohody, tedy Francie, Spojeného království a Srbska proti Německu, Rakousko-Uhersku a Osmanské říši. Ruská říše fungovala jako absolutní monarchie na ideologické doktríně pravoslaví, autokracie a národnosti až do revoluce roku 1905, kdy byla ustavena de iure konstituční monarchie. Říše se zhroutila během únorové revoluce v roce 1917, hlavně v důsledku obrovských selhání vyplývajících z účasti v první světové válce. Carská rodina byla v roce 1918 zavražděna bolševiky, kteří před převzetím moci uvěznili nebo popravili mnoho aristokratů, což nakonec vyústilo k vytvoření Svazu sovětských socialistických republik. Roku 1897 činila rozloha impéria 22 400 000 km² (pro porovnání: dnešní Ruská federace zaujímá 17 075 200 km²), téhož roku zde žilo 128 200 000 obyvatel, z nichž přibližně polovinu tvořili Rusové. Říše byla rozdělena na 81 gubernií, 20 oblastí a 1 okruh (stav v roce 1914).","lang":"cs"},{"type":"literal","value":"俄罗斯帝国（俄語：Российская империя）在中文中常简称为帝俄、沙俄、俄国，是存在于18世纪至20世纪的统一君主制国家，也是俄罗斯历史上最后一个君主制国家。1721年，俄国沙皇彼得一世率军擊潰瑞典帝國赢得大北方战争后，改称“全俄罗斯皇帝”（Император Всероссийский），创立俄罗斯帝国。雖然俄羅斯帝國的君主已按照西方慣例明確改稱“皇帝”，但在當時的歐洲依然習慣性的稱呼俄羅斯皇帝為“沙皇”。 俄罗斯帝国由罗曼诺夫王朝统治，彼得一世为首位皇帝。彼得一世在位期间展开改革，使得帝俄在经济、军事和文化上均有显著的进步，开創效法西欧的近代化的先例。在大北方战争中，俄国击败北欧强权瑞典帝國，取得波罗的海出海口，由純粹的内陆国转变为滨海国，被欧洲承認為列强之一。帝国在叶卡捷琳娜二世女皇统治时期步入黄金时代，透過三次瓜分波蘭和两次对土作战的手段，夺得黑海出海口並将帝国的西部边界深入中欧。在拿破仑战争期间，俄国积极参与反法同盟，透過俄法战争成為唯一能在陸軍上遏法军入侵的國家。维也纳会议后，帝俄主导奧地利帝國和普魯士王國成立神圣同盟，再次從瑞典手中奪取整個芬蘭大公國，成为了僅次於大英帝國的歐洲第二大列強，人稱“歐洲憲兵”。在随后的新帝国主义时期，其势力范围继续向高加索、中亚和远东三方面扩张，完全毀滅了世界上最後一批遊牧民族國家、囊括整個中亞，成為侵佔清朝領土最多的國家。帝俄在版图上於在19世纪中期达到极盛，横跨欧亚大陆，北起北冰洋、南达黑海南部，西起波罗的海、东达阿拉斯加，涵盖中亚、北高加索及芬兰地区，与挪威、瑞典、德国、奥匈帝国、罗马尼亚、奥斯曼帝国、波斯、阿富汗、中國、朝鲜與日本接壤，按国土面积计算，成为历史上国土面积第三大的帝国。根据1897年人口普查，其人口达到1.25亿，位居世界第三，仅次于大英帝国和大清帝国。 尽管帝俄在政治、军事、外交和菁英文化上皆为当时欧洲数一数二的强国，俄罗斯帝国在经济、科技、社會制度、教育上卻在歐洲敬陪末座。15世纪至19世纪中期，因為農奴制度牽制了生產力、東正教腐化貴族思想、未曾经历大规模的产业革命，導致帝國的國力開始衰弱。在亚历山大二世统治时期，俄国于克里米亚战争败於早已近代化的英法，继而於1861年展开对内的大规模农奴制改革，宣告废除农奴制；但由于俄国本身幅员辽阔，無法一次性改革到位，還觸動了国内在既得利益者，加劇了俄國人在民族和宗教上分歧。受19世纪中期欧洲革命风潮影响，反对俄羅斯自古君主专制传统的浪潮此起彼伏，人民要求建立共和體制、甚至讓少數民族獨立，此矛盾在1881年達到最高峰，皇帝亚历山大二世被激进主义者炸死。其子亚历山大三世意識到俄國不能再故步自封，於是強勢介入推進改革，不過成就依然不如英法美德等西方進步國家。在1905年，俄羅斯帝国在日俄战争中被亚洲的新兴强权日本击败，連續兩次重大戰爭的失敗讓帝俄國內一片罵聲，認為其原因是日本後來居上的制定憲法，诱發1905年俄国革命，這場革命促使皇帝尼古拉二世实行在立憲的框架下實施俄羅斯帝國基本法，并由首相斯托雷平展开经济改革，，之後帝俄繼續養精蓄銳，積極修建铁路、兴办近代工厂、建立近代化军队，獲得了長期的和平，和經濟和人口雙雙繁榮。直到1914年，第一次世界大戰把全部改革成果毀於一旦。 帝俄自称“第三罗马”，视己為拜占庭帝国的正統后继者，担负保卫东正教信仰的责任。俄国在尼古拉一世期间确立“君主专制-东正教-民族性”的三維官方民族理论，在外交上奉行泛斯拉夫主义，积极支持巴尔干半岛信仰东正教的南斯拉夫人的民族主义运动，而巴爾幹半島為舊奧斯曼帝國領土上的空白地帶，導致其和奧匈帝國發生嚴重利益衝突。1914年爆发萨拉热窝事件，奥匈帝国向和俄羅斯同樣的斯拉夫民族东正教国家塞尔维亚王国宣战，帝俄基於泛斯拉夫主義堅持幫助塞尔维亚一方而参战，并作为协约国的一员，拉動英法一同对抗奥匈帝国及其背後的盟主德意志帝国，被迫捲入第一次世界大战。俄羅斯帝国难以支应德国的攻势，自此深入战争泥潭；1917年，二月革命爆发，罗曼诺夫王朝被推翻，宣告俄罗斯帝国以及俄羅斯君主統治徹底终结。","lang":"zh"},{"type":"literal","value":"The Russian Empire was a historical empire that extended across Eurasia and North America from 1721, following the end of the Great Northern War, until the Republic was proclaimed by the Provisional Government that took power after the February Revolution of 1917.

It played a major role in 1812–1814 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe and expanded to the west and south, becoming one of the most powerful European empires of all time. The House of Romanov ruled the Russian Empire from 1721 until 1762. Its matrilineal branch of patrilineal German descent, the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov, ruled from 1762 until the end of the empire. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Russian Empire extended from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea in the south, from the Baltic Sea on the west into Alaska and Northern California in America on the east. With 125.6 million subjects registered by the 1897 census, it had the third-largest population in the world at the time, after Qing China and India. Like all empires, it featured great diversity in terms of economies, ethnicities, languages, and religions. There were many dissident elements that launched numerous rebellions and assassinations over the centuries. In the 19th century, they were closely watched by the imperial secret police, and thousands were exiled to Siberia. The empire had a predominantly agricultural economy, with low productivity on large estates worked by Russian peasants, known as serfs, who were tied to the land in a feudal arrangement. The serfs were freed in 1861, but the landowning aristocratic class kept control. The economy slowly industrialized with the help of foreign investments in railways and factories. From the 10th through the 17th centuries, the land was ruled by a noble class, the boyars, and subsequently by an emperor. Tsar Ivan III (1462–1505) laid the groundwork for the empire that later emerged. He tripled the territory of his state, ended the dominance of the Golden Horde, renovated the Moscow Kremlin, and laid the foundations of the Russian state. Emperor Peter the Great (1682–1725) fought numerous wars and expanded an already huge empire into a major European power. He moved the capital from Moscow to the new model city of Saint Petersburg, which featured much Western design. He led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political mores with a modern, scientific, Europe-oriented, and rationalist system. Empress Catherine the Great (reigned 1762–1796) presided over a golden age; she expanded the state by conquest, colonization and diplomacy, continuing Peter the Great's (Peter I's) policy of modernization along Western European lines. Emperor Alexander II (1855–1881) promoted numerous reforms, most dramatically the emancipation of all 23 million serfs in 1861. His policy in Eastern Europe involved protecting the Orthodox Christians under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. That connection by 1914 led to Russia's entry into World War I on the side of France and the United Kingdom against the German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman empires. The Russian Empire functioned as an absolute monarchy on the ideological doctrine of Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality until the Revolution of 1905, when a semi-constitutional monarchy was established. It functioned poorly during World War I. Tsar Nicholas II was executed and the imperial family murdered in 1918 by the Bolsheviks, who took power in the 1920s after the Revolution and a bloody Civil War with the White Army, forced into exile (or executed) most of the aristocratic class, and repressed many others, culminating in the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922.","lang":"en"},{"type":"literal","value":"The Russian Empire was an empire that extended across Eurasia and North America from 1721, following the end of the Great Northern War, until the Republic was proclaimed by the Provisional Government that took power after the February Revolution of 1917.
