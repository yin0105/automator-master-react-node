Moskwa jest siedzibą najwyższych władz państwowych Rosji w tym: prezydenta, parlamentu (Dumy Państwowej i Rady Federacji) oraz rządu. W przeszłości miasto było stolicą: Księstwa Moskiewskiego (1213–1328), Wielkiego Księstwa Moskiewskiego (1328–1547), Carstwa Rosyjskiego (1547–1712), Rosji Radzieckiej (1918–1991) i Związku Radzieckiego (1922–1991). Moskwa jest także stolicą Rosyjskiego Kościoła Prawosławnego. Znajduje się tu ponad 600 świątyń różnych wyznań, w tym Cerkiew Chrystusa Zbawiciela – największa na świecie cerkiew prawosławna, a także Monaster Daniłowski – siedziba patriarchy moskiewskiego i całej Rusi. Podczas II wojny światowej Moskwa jako jedyna stolica europejska odparła ataki niemieckie, za co nadano jej tytuł „miasto-bohater”. Miasto jest obecnie jednym z najważniejszych ośrodków finansowych świata. W światowym rankingu pod względem kosztów życia Moskwa zajęła w 2006 pierwsze miejsce jako najdroższe miasto świata, w 2009 była trzecia. W rankingu miast światowych miesięcznika „Forbes” Moskwa zajęła w 2011 po raz kolejny z rzędu pierwsze miejsce pod względem liczby zamieszkujących ją miliarderów (79 osób). Wcześniej, w 2009, w rankingu tym przejściowo z pierwszego spadła na trzecie miejsce. W 1990 historyczne centrum miasta (Kreml oraz plac Czerwony wraz z nawiązującymi do nich obiektami) zostało wpisane na Listę światowego dziedzictwa UNESCO.","lang":"pl"},{"type":"literal","value":"Moscou (en rus Москва́, transcrit Moskvà ) és la capital de Rússia.

Il Cremlino e la Piazza Rossa sono uno dei tanti siti Patrimonio dell'umanità situati nel territorio dell'oblast' moscovita. Anche il Parlamento russo (composto dalla Duma di Stato e dal Consiglio federale) ha sede nella città. Mosca è rinomata per i suoi stili architettonici unici, ammirabili in una pluralità di edifici storici, tra cui la celebre Cattedrale di San Basilio con le sue cupole colorate, la Cattedrale di Cristo Salvatore, i magazzini GUM, e l'Esposizione delle conquiste dell'economia nazionale. La città è sede della Torre di Ostankino, la più alta struttura d'Europa; della Torre della Federazione, il secondo più alto grattacielo d'Europa e del Centro internazionale di affari di Mosca. Con più del 40% del suo territorio ricoperto da piante, è una delle capitali più verdi d'Europa e del mondo; tra i parchi principali della città sono menzionabili il parco Gor'kij, il parco Kolomenskoe e il parco Caricyno. Mosca è considerata il centro della cultura russa, essendo luogo di nascita e di residenza di celebri artisti, scienziati e sportivi russi del passato e del presente, nonché sede di numerosissimi musei, accademie, istituzioni politiche e teatri. La città è servita da un'ampia rete di trasporti, che include 4 aeroporti internazionali (Šeremet'evo, Domodedovo, Vnukovo e Žukovskij), 9 stazioni ferroviarie, numerosi tram, un sistema monorotaia, un sistema ferroviario di superficie, un sistema di cabinovia, uno sviluppato servizio di car sharing e di bike sharing e la metropolitana, che è una delle più grandi e profonde del mondo, la più frequentata in Europa e la quarta più frequentata al mondo; essa è uno dei punti di riferimento della città ed è famosa per la ricchezza dell'architettura delle sue 200 stazioni (di particolare pregio artistico, tra le altre, sono le stazioni di Komsomol'skaja, Ploščad' Revoljucii e Kievskaja).

Sur le plan administratif Moscou fait partie du district fédéral central et a le statut de ville d'importance fédérale qui lui donne le même niveau d'autonomie que les autres sujets de la Russie. Elle est quasiment enclavée dans l'oblast de Moscou, mais en est administrativement indépendante. Ses habitants sont les Moscovites. Moscou se situe dans la partie européenne de la Russie au milieu d'une région de plaine. Sa latitude élevée lui vaut un climat froid et continental. Le Kremlin, son cœur historique, est édifié sur une colline qui domine la rive gauche de la rivière Moskova. Moscou a joué un rôle central dans l'histoire de la Russie. Petit point d'appui militaire créé vers 1150 dans le nord de la Rus' de Kiev, elle prend progressivement le relais de Kiev, après la décomposition politique de cet État et les invasions mongoles du XIIIe siècle. Elle devient la capitale du Grand-duché de Moscou puis de l'Empire russe qui étend progressivement son territoire jusqu'à la frontière avec la Pologne à l'ouest, la Crimée au sud et l'océan Pacifique à l'est. Elle perd son rôle de capitale au profit de Saint-Pétersbourg lorsque Pierre le Grand au début du XVIIIe siècle décide de moderniser son pays à marche forcée. Néanmoins, au cours des XVIIIe et XIXe siècles, Moscou devient un centre industriel majeur et le cœur du réseau de communications ferré et routier d'un pays qui compte désormais parmi les grandes puissances européennes. La Révolution d'Octobre en 1917 redonne le rôle de capitale à Moscou et met en place un régime communiste qui accélère en deux décennies l'industrialisation de la ville et quadruple la population qui passe de un à quatre millions d'habitants. Ayant échappé de peu à l'occupation allemande durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, la ville renoue avec une croissance économique et démographique effrénée à l'issue de celle-ci. Elle devient la capitale d'une des deux superpuissances mondiales. L'effondrement du régime communiste en 1991 entraîne une profonde transformation de la ville qui abandonne presque complètement son rôle de centre industriel au profit d'une position de pôle tertiaire complètement converti à l'économie de marché. La construction du Centre de commerce international de Moscou est le symbole de cette transformation. Moscou concentre une part particulièrement importante de la richesse économique du pays : elle produit 25 % du PIB de la Russie. La ville est le siège de nombreuses institutions universitaires et culturelles du pays. Mais cette mutation ne s'est pas faite sans poser de problèmes, les écarts socio-économiques étant devenus considérables : une part de la population s'est fortement enrichie, tandis que l'augmentation du coût de la vie a aggravé les conditions de vie des plus modestes. Moscou a du mal à adapter ses structures routières à l'explosion du parc des véhicules des particuliers et à une croissance démographique qui se poursuit dans un contexte national pourtant déprimé sur ce plan. Moscou dispose d'un important patrimoine artistique et architectural dont trois ensembles inscrits au Patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco. Ce sont notamment le Kremlin avec ses palais et églises, la cathédrale Saint-Basile-le-Bienheureux sur la place Rouge, la galerie Tretiakov, le couvent de Novodievitchi, l'église de Kolomenskoïe ainsi que les sept gratte-ciel staliniens.","lang":"fr"},{"type":"literal","value":"Moscow (/ˈmɒskoʊ/, /ˈmɒskaʊ/; Russian: Москва, tr.

Situated on the Moskva River in the Central Federal District of Western Russia, the city is the northernmost and coldest megacity on Earth. With a history that dates over eight centuries, Moscow is governed as a federal city that serves as the political, economic, cultural, and scientific centre of Russia and Eastern Europe. Originally established in 1147 as a minor town, Moscow grew to become a prosperous and powerful city that served as the capital of the Grand Duchy that bears its namesake. When the Grand Duchy of Moscow evolved into the Tsardom of Russia, Moscow still remained as the political and economic center for most of the Tsardom's history. When the Tsardom was reformed into the Russian Empire, the capital was moved from Moscow to Saint Petersburg, diminishing the influence of the city. The capital was then moved back to Moscow following the Russian Revolution and the city was brought back as the political centre of the Soviet Russia and the USSR. When the USSR dissolved, Moscow remained as the capital city of the contemporary and newly-established Russian Federation. As the cultural centre of Russia, Moscow served as the home of Russian artists, scientists, and sports figures due to the presence of its numerous museums, academic and political institutions and theatres. The city is home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and is well known for its display of Russian architecture such as the Saint Basil's Cathedral, the Red Square, and the Moscow Kremlin, of which the latter serves as the seat of power of the Government of Russia. Moscow is home to many Russian companies in numerous industries, such as finance and technology. Moscow is served by a comprehensive transit network, which includes four international airports, nine railway terminals, a tram system, a monorail system, and most notably the Moscow Metro – the busiest metro system in Europe, and one of the largest rapid transit systems in the world.","lang":"en"}],"sepMeanC":[{"type":"literal","value":12.9,"datatype":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double"},{"type":"literal","value":11.1,"datatype":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double"}],"title":[{"type":"literal","value":"Religion
